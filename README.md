## Installation

To install graphbase-core library you can run:

```
npm i --save-dev graphbase-core
```

## Usage

The only thing that the user should create and provide to the graphbase-core library is the input schema file.

### Example Schema

The example schema could look like this:

```graphql
directive @model on OBJECT

type Person @model {
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
  age: Int!
  height: Float
  hasDrivingLicenses: Boolean
  interests: [Interests!]!
}

type Interests @model {
  name: String!
  description: String
}

type Query {
  version: String
}

type Mutation {
  version: String
}

schema {
  query: Query
  mutation: Mutation
}
```

Please remember that schema must contain schema type with any Query and Mutation type.

### How to generate backend

For all types marked with directive @models graphbase-core library will generate:

- output schema with all required types, inputs, queries and mutations
- typescript models
- CRUD resolvers
- routing file

Default command:

```
npx graphbase-core
```

If you want to specify input schema path you can run:

```
npx graphbase-core --inputSchema pathToInputSchema
```

After running one of these commands graphbase-core library will generate all models and resolvers required to run your backend!

### How to start generated backend

Before running your backend you should configure your typescript build and provide database URL in .env file.

To build your project properly you should add two lines to your tsconfig.json:

```json
  "compilerOptions": {
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "outDir": "./lib"
  }
```

The last configuration step is creating a .env file with a connection link to your mongoDb database. Example .env file:

```
DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://userName:password@cluster0.nv1zf.mongodb.net/collection-name?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

If you follow all configuration steps you can add to your package.json script like this below and run it:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "tsc --build tsconfig.json && dotenv -e .env stucco"
  }
```

After that,the backend is running on port 8080 and you can execute all CRUD operations to your database!
